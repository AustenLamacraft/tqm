# Theories of Quantum Matter

These are the materials for the Part III course Theories of Quantum Matter at the University of Cambridge

- The `master` branch contains the lecture notes that are published on [my site](https://auste.nl).

- The branch `lecture-notes-<year>` contains the files with annotations made during the lectures in `<year>`.

- View these with the Markdown viewer of your choice, ideally one that is LaTeX-aware: I recommend [Typora](https://typora.io) (you will need to turn on the options for Inline Math and Equation Numbering in the preferences panel).

- Alternatively you could convert to PDF using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org).

- Feel free to [submit any issues](https://github.com/AustenLamacraft/tqm/issues) with the notes!

## Switching between master (for Hugo site) and lecture notes (for Typora)

- Figures for Hugo follow the format: `{{< figure src="HOM.png" title="Four possible outcomes after the passage of two bosons through a beam splitter." numbered="true" lightbox="true" >}}`

- Figures for Typora use standard markdown

## TODOs

- [ ] Internal references among lectures

- [ ] LaTeX in figure captions for Hugo

- [ ] Citations for Hugo

- [ ] Make Typora template in the Academic style, allowing for sidenotes. Look into [Tufte CSS](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/)

## Content TODOs

1. Nice idea for a second quantization problem: two particles hopping on a 2x2 square. Work out matrix elements for the cases of bosons and fermions, to show that fermions are not just impenetrable bosons. For fermions the configuration space is six dimensional
