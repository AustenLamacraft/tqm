# Theories of Quantum Matter

These are the materials for the Part III course Theories of Quantum Matter at the University of Cambridge

- The `master` branch contains the lecture notes that are published on [my site](https://auste.nl).

- The branch `lecture-notes-<year>` contains the files with annotations made during the lectures in `<year>`. View these with the Markdown viewer of your choice, ideally one that is LaTeX-aware: I recomment [Typora](https://typora.io).

- Feel free to [submit an issue](https://github.com/AustenLamacraft/tqm/issues) with the notes!
